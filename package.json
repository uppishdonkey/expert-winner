When the user chooses to view all departments, then the user is presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids. When the user chooses to view all roles, then the user is presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role. When the user chooses to view all employees, then I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to. When the user chooses to add a department, then the user is prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database.
